\section{Description of the database}

The database\cite{Lazebnik2005} contains 1000 gray scale images in JPG format, every images has a 640*480 pixels resolution. Images are close ups of a given object surface, thus, containing textures found in different objects \footnote{The object clases are: Bark Wood, Water, Granite, Marble, Floors, Pebbles, Wall Brick, Glass, Carpet, Upholstery, Wallpaper, Fur, Knit, Corduroy \& Plaid }. There are 40 samples for each class. The databaset is divided into test and train. There is a final idex file plain text file with the naming convention for the images.

Time considwerations. 

The tetxon calculation is a time consuming task, the following table sumarizes the timae taken according to the amount of images utilized to build the database


\begin{tabular}{ c | c | c }		
  images & resolution & time (S) \\
  \hline	
  1 &  & 58\\
  2 &  & 170 \\
  3 &  & 250 \\
  4 &  & 389 \\
  5 &  & 495 \\
  \hline  
\end{tabular}

Differentiation is now a technique taught to mathematics students throughout the world. In this document I will discuss some aspects of differentiation.

\section{Exploring the derivative using Sage}

The definition of the limit of $f(x)$ at $x=a$ denoted as $f'(a)$ is:

\begin{equation}
f'(a) = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
\end{equation}

The following code can be used in sage to give the above limit:

\begin{verbatim}
def illustrate(f, a):
    """
    Function to take a function and illustrate the limiting definition of a derivative at a given point.
    """
    lst = []
    for h in srange(.01, 3, .01):
    	lst.append([h,(f(a+h)-f(a))/h])
    return list_plot(lst, axes_labels=['$x$','$\\frac{f(%.02f+h)-f(%.02f)}{h}$' % (a,a)])
\end{verbatim}



If we want to plot the tangent at a point $\alpha$ to a function we can use the following:

\begin{align}
y=&ax+b&&\text{(definition of a straight line)}\nonumber\\
  &f'(a)x+b&&\text{(definition of the derivative)}\nonumber\\
  &f'(a)x+f(a)-f'(a)a&&\text{(we know that the line intersects $f$ at $(a,f(a))$}\nonumber
\end{align}

We can combine this with the approach of the previous piece of code to see how the tangential line converges as the limiting definition of the derivative converges:

\begin{verbatim}
def convergetangentialline(f, a, x1, x2, nbrofplots=50, epsilon=.1):
    """
    Function to make a tangential line converge
    """
    clrs = rainbow(nbrofplots)
    k = 0
    h = epsilon
    p = plot(f, x, x1, x2)
    while k < nbrofplots:
        tangent(x) = fdash(f, a, h) * x + f(a) - fdash(f, a, h) * a
        p += plot(tangent(x), x, x1, x2, color=clrs[k])
        h += epsilon
        k += 1
    return p
\end{verbatim}

The plot shown in Figure \ref{lines} shows how the lines shown converge to the actual tangent to $1-x^2$ as $x=2$ (the red line is the `closest' curve).


Note here that the last plot is given using the \textbf{real} definition of the derivative and not the approximation.

\section{Conclusions}

In this report I have explored the limiting definition of the limit showing how as $h\to 0$ we can visualise the derivative of a function. The code involved \url{https://sage.maths.cf.ac.uk/home/pub/18/} uses the differentiation capabilities of Sage but also the plotting abilities.

There are various other aspects that could be explored such as symbolic differentiation rules. For example:

$$\frac{dx^n}{dx}=(n+1)x^{n}\text{ if }x\ne-1$$

Furthermore it is interesting to not that there exists some functions that \textbf{are not} differentiable at a point such as the function $f(x)=\sin(1/x)$ which is not differentiable at $x=0$. A plot of this function is shown in Figure \ref{notdiff}.
