The selected images are of two puppies: a west higland terrier (left) and a Germand Shepperd (right). The hardware used to make the pictures is very diffrente. The pictre of the terrier was made with a low resolution ccd sensor on an Asus note 7 table and the second wans meade with a nikkon L820 camera. Hence the resolution is very differnt; the original terrier picture has a resolution of 960x1280 pixels (2 mp), the  shepperd pictos has an original resolution of 4608x3456 (16 mp). It is also worth noticin that the orientation of the original iamges is very different (portrait and landscape)

###Image Transformation
While the position and orientaton of the dog faces is very close, some simple operation have to be maade to better aling the images. 
First, As the image of the german shepperd is at much higher resolution, it is rescaled to smaller resltion so that both images have the same height.
Second, images are croped to 600x680 size. The main goal for this cropping operation is to keep the eyes of the dogs close to the center of the image.
Third, the  image of the german shepper is rotated 12 degrees to the left to better align the eyes and noses of the dogs
These are the resulting images
